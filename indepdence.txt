The first nationalistic revolutionary movement for Indian independence emerged from 
Bengal.It later took root in the newly formed Indian National Congress with
 prominent moderate leaders seeking only their fundamental right to appear 
for Indian Civil Service examinations in British India, as well as more rights
 for the people of the soil. 
The early part of the 20th century saw a more radical approach towards political self-rule proposed by 
leaders such as the Lal, Bal, Pal triumvirate, and Aurobindo Ghosh, V. O. Chidambaram Pillai

The last stages of the self-rule struggle from the 1920s was characterized by Congress's adoption of 
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's policy of non-violence and civil disobedience, and several other campaigns
. Nationalists like Subhash Chandra Bose, Bhagat Singh, Bagha Jatin, Surya Sen preached armed revolution
 to achieve self-rule. Poets and writers such as Rabindranath Tagore, Subramania Bharati, Bankim Chandra
 Chattopadhyay and Kazi Nazrul Islam used literature, poetry, and speech as a tool for political awareness.
 Feminists like Sarojini Naidu, Pritilata Waddedar, Begum Rokeya promoted the emancipation of Indian women 
and their participation in national politics.B. R. Ambedkar championed the cause of the disadvantaged sections 
of Indian society within the more significant self-rule movement.The period of the World War II saw the peak of
 the campaigns by the Quit India Movement led by Congress and the Indian National Army movement led by Subhash
 Chandra Bose with the help of Japan.
